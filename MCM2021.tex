\subsection{Analysis of The Problem}

\subsection{Assumptions}



\section{The Buildup of The model and Calculating}
From what is analyzed before, we can conclude that:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial (FR)}{\partial (ER)} =C_1
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial \ln(FR) }{\partial M} =C_2
\end{equation}

\subsection{Strengths}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Applies widely}\\
This  system can be used for many types\cite{bush2006mathematical} of airplanes, and it also
solves the interference during  the procedure of the boarding
airplane,as described above we can get to the  optimization
boarding time.We also know that all the service is automate.
\item \textbf{Improve the quality of the airport service}\\
Balancing the cost of the cost and the benefit, it will bring in
more convenient  for airport and passengers.It also saves many
human resources for the airline. \item \textbf{}

\section{First appendix}

In addition, your report must include a letter to the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the Goodgrant Foundation, Mr. Alpha Chiang, that describes the optimal investment strategy, your modeling approach and major results, and a brief discussion of your proposed concept of a return-on-investment (ROI). This letter should be no more than two pages in length.

\begin{letter}{Dear, Mr. Alpha Chiang}

Sincerely yours,

Your friends
