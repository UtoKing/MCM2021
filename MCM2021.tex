\subsection{Assumptions}
Here are our assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Under an ideal environment, which means that the temperature is perfect and the food is sufficient, the decomposition rate of fungis is mainly related to the extension rate and the moisture trade-off.
  \item The decomposition rate has a linear relationship with extension rate.
  \item The logarithm of decomposition rate has a linear relationship with moisture trade-off.
  \item If the environment is not so perfect, we introduce two parameters to adjust the decomposition rate---temperature and fungi's proportion.
\end{itemize}

With such condition, we can conclude two partial differential equations:
