	abstract = {Fungi play a key role in the global carbon cycle as the main decomposers of litter and wood. Although current climate models reflect limited functional variation in microbial groups, fungi differ vastly in their decomposing ability. Here, we examine which traits explain fungal-mediated wood decomposition. In a laboratory study of 34 fungal isolates, we found that decomposing ability varies along a spectrum from stress-tolerant, poorly decomposing fungi to fast-growing, competitive fungi that rapidly decompose wood. We observed similar patterns in a 5-y field experiment, in which communities of fast-growing fungi more rapidly decomposed logs in the forest. Finally, we show how linking decomposition rates to known spatial patterns in fungal traits could improve broad-scale predictions of wood decomposition by fungi.As the primary decomposers of organic material in terrestrial ecosystems, fungi are critical agents of the global carbon cycle. Yet our ability to link fungal community composition to ecosystem functioning is constrained by a limited understanding of the factors accounting for different wood decomposition rates among fungi. Here we examine which traits best explain fungal decomposition ability by combining detailed trait-based assays on 34 saprotrophic fungi from across North America in the laboratory with a 5-y field study comprising 1,582 fungi isolated from 74 decomposing logs. Fungal growth rate (hyphal extension rate) was the strongest single predictor of fungal-mediated wood decomposition rate under laboratory conditions, and accounted for up to 27\% of the in situ variation in decomposition in the field. At the individual level, decomposition rate was negatively correlated with moisture niche width (an indicator of drought stress tolerance) and with the production of nutrient-mineralizing extracellular enzymes. Together, these results suggest that decomposition rates strongly align with a dominance-tolerance life-history trade-off that was previously identified in these isolates, forming a spectrum from slow-growing, stress-tolerant fungi that are poor decomposers to fast-growing, highly competitive fungi with fast decomposition rates. Our study illustrates how an understanding of fungal trait variation could improve our predictive ability of the early and midstages of wood decay, to which our findings are most applicable. By mapping our results onto the biogeographic distribution of the dominance-tolerance trade-off across North America, we approximate broad-scale patterns in intrinsic fungal-mediated wood decomposition rates.},

 abstract = {Bacterial and fungal counts, mycelial growth, microbial evolution of Co"2", and substrate moisture and temperature in bags with litter of either mulberry, redbud, white oak, loblolly pine, or beech were measured biweekly over the period November 1960-November 1961 in oak, pine, and maple stands at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Serial dilution plate method and closed-box technique were effective for measuring microbial densities and microbial respiration respectively. Microbial densities, microbial respiration, and annual weight losses of species declined in the order mulberry, redbud, white oak, pine, beech, ad were significantly positively correlated. Stand effects were not significant possibly due to partial exclusion of stand effects in the bags. Microbial densities and moisture conditions of the various leaf species converged with time and their short-term fluctuations decreased indicating homogenation of substrate and stabilization of microbial populations. Microbial respiration was controlled in decreasing order by temperature (T), bacterial density (B), moisture (M/D), and the number of weeks (W) since leaf drop. An effective model for prediction of microbial respiration (C) is C = 46.5 + 3.2T + 26.9 M/D + 11.4 log B - 0.6W. Mean CO"2 production was 0.17 liters/g substrate decomposed. Production was higher for rapidly decomposing leaf species dominated by relatively inefficient bacterial flora than for slowly decaying litter with predominantly more efficient fungi. Loss of weight and respiration were highly correlated with a microbial population estimate, combining bacterial and fungal counts.},
